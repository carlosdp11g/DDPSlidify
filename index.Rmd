## Why
- People wait for an important date.
- The days remaining for a deadline of a project or anything is relevant to know.
- It's good to be aware and prepared.

## What it does
1. Allows the user to select from an input widget a range of dates.
2. Processes both dates and counts the days between them.
3. Displays to the user the amount of days remaining to get to the second date.

It can also display days remaining without counting weekends.

## In action
Simulating an input for dates between 2015-06-22 to 2015-08-10 (when the semester begins):
```{r echo = TRUE}
fechas <- c("2015-06-22", "2015-08-10")
fechas <- as.Date(fechas)
## With weekends
confines <- fechas[2] - fechas[1]
## Without weekends
wd <- weekdays(seq(fechas[1], fechas[2], by = "days"))
entresemana <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "lunes", "martes", 
                 "miÃ©rcoles", "jueves", "viernes")
sinfines <- paste("Time difference of ", length(wd[wd %in% entresemana]), " days.")
```

Results:
With weekends: Time differences of `r confines` days.
Without weekends: `r sinfines`
